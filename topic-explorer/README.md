# UKDS Topic Explorer App Tutorial

This is a starter kit for the UKDS "Topic Explorer" programming tutorial. It's
a bit more complex than the other two tutorial apps, so we use a couple of
very tiny but very helpful libraries to make building easier.

## Libraries used:

  * [Bijou CSS](https://github.com/andhart/bijou) for a nicer look.
  * [Riot.js](https://github.com/riot/riot) for the main work of building the
    app in a reactive way.
  * [Nimble](http://caolan.github.io/nimble/) for filtering and transforming
    batches of data that we receive from the Open Data API.
  * [nanoajax](https://github.com/yanatan16/nanoajax) for loading the data.
